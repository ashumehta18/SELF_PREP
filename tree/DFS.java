// depth first search

1. It starts from a source vertex and 
       explores each path as completely as possible
                              before backtracking to explore other paths.

 2.  TO avoid revisiting of array = A 'visited' array or set is used to keep track of vertices 
                                     that have already been visited.

  3. Yes, the traversal order can change depending on the order in which adjacent vertices are selected to be visited
    === single graph have more than one valid DFS traversal sequence
